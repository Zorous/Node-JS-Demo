✅Nodemon package✅ :
> while we are coding, it monitors our application files 
so when it's running on the browser while listening to a server,
it detects automatically the changes and renders them in the browser 
so we wont have to restart the server to see the modifications manually with
a simple refresh. so it simply just restarting the server for us each time 
we make a change and we can install it using this cmd : 

>> npm install -g nodemon

-g : means the installation will be globally, that means it won't install in our 
node_modules folder just on that application, it will be installed locally
so when we gonna need it on the future on another application, we wont have 
to install it again since it's already installed in my computer


⭐the last thing is to run our application we wont use "node app"
to run our app, we will use "nodemon app" instead 




✅Express package✅ :

> Express is a package also, which makes the routing process much easier 
and helps us also to integrates with many templating engines very easily

and we can install it using this cmd : 
>> npm install express



✅EJS Package✅ :
> it's a light templating engine that helps us integrate some dynamic content into our code
simply like that : <h1> <=% variable_name %> </h1>

and we can install it like that : 
>> npm install ejs


⭐ but to use it we will have to follow some steps first : 
1 - setting it as our default View engine using the set() method in our routing files
like this : 
 >> app.set('view engine','ejs')

2 - we will need to create a View folder in our project since the EJS's engine default behavior 
is looking for a folder with that name 

3 - whenever we create an html file or View, we should change it's extension from 
html to ejs

4 - we don't use the send file method anymore,
 we will use the render method (so similar to React)





✅Body Parser✅ :
while handling a form POST request we will use this package
and what it does is parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, 
are available under the 'req.body' property.
and we can install it like that
>> npm install body-parser
