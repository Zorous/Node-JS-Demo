With the Template Engine helps us inject some dynamic content into our HTML Code.
so what does it do is helps us to integrate data in javascript code into our HTML files

there's so much templating engines, but we will use a light weight one called "EJS"
and we can do it simply like that :
=>  <h1> <=% variable_name %> </h1>

but to use it we will have to follow some steps first : 
1 - setting it as our default View engine using the set() method in our routing files
like this : 
 >> app.set('view engine','ejs')

2 - we will need to create a View folder in our project since the EJS's engine default behavior 
is looking for a folder with that name 

3 - whenever we create an html file or View, we should change it's extension from 
html to ejs

4 - we don't use the send file method anymore,
 we will use the render method (so similar to React)






 ------------------Partial Templates----------------------

 We can use it to integrate a NavBar on all our views without having 
 to integrate it on each one (include)
 just like the old ways on PHP we use an include method
 and we use it like that  :
 <%- include('fileName') -%>
  or
 <%- include('./Dirname/fileName') -%>
