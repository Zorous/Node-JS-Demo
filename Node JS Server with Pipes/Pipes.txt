/* 
This process of reading data from a Read Stream and transfering data via the WriteStream is quire commune in Node JS

a pipe can help us do exactly the same thing, on the commune way after we read Data we transfer it manually using the writeStream
BUT using a pipe we can do the writing process automatically (pipping it)

var fs = require('fs');

var http = require('http');


var myReadStream = fs.ReadStream(__dirname+"/ReadMe.txt",'utf-8')

var myWriteStream = fs.WriteStream(__dirname+"/WriteMe.txt")

//using the pipe method simply we can it
myReadStream.pipe(myWriteStream);
