- POST is a request method, so basically we are asking the server to accept or store some data
which is on the body of a request
the data we are posting to the server is in the Request body itself

- Often used in submitting forms

just like PHP :

1- we add the action and the method type in our form, and don't forget to set assign a name to you inputs
exe : 
    <form id="contact-form" method="POST" action="/contact"></form>


2 - we go to where we have the routing methods, it's app.js in our case
we will use a body parser package called "body-parser" which parses the incoming
request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, 
are available under the 'req.body' property
after installing it using : >> npm install body-parser
we should require it in our app.js file like that 
>> var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
>> var urlencodedParser = bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended : false});
