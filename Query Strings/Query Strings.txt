=> A query string is just an additional Data added into the http request, 
in the form of name : value pass

exe: "mysite.com/blog/news?page2"

we can pass many name value pairs, just with adding & between them, just like how we do on PHP.
exe : "mysite.com/contact?person=Oussama&major=SoftwareDevelopment"

The Express package handles with it's request object all those things for us.
so when we do log in a get method the request object > query
>> console.log(req.query)
//we will get an object with key value pairs like that
>> {
    person : "Oussama",
    major  : "SoftwareDevelopment"
   }

but instead of just loging it we could pass it to our view to handle that request in the
render() method

res.render('contact',{qs : req.query})
