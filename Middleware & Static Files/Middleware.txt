when we try to integrate an external css file or deal with any document it wont work
bcs in the end, the css static file is making a request to server but our app
running on node js is not responding to this request.
so what we could do is creating different handlers for those requests,
for images and stylesheets etc..

but fortunately we can use something called Middleware.
it's an Express In-Built Middleware

So Middleware is essentially the code that runs between requests and responses 
so it's in the Middle.
and e can use it like this
>>app.use()
//we could match it to a routing if we want or if we don't put a routing, it's gonna use a routing
on every request that is made


so lets suppose we have our style sheet "style.css" in an assets folder 
we need to make it like that then

***********************M1****************************
>>app.use('/assets',function(req, res, next){
console.log(req.url)

next();
})
****************************************************
//what we did is whenever someone visits "/assets" or "/assets/something else"
 we will fire a function, this function takes the request object parameter and 
 the response object parameter, and also an additional parameter called "next" and it's a method
 so when we run our function, we need a way to tell node js to move to the next method,request or 
 Middleware, so all what we do in the end of this Middleware we write 
 ⭐"next()"
 if don't put it the application will crush or break

 Also express comes already with some inbuilt methods we can use to handle the interaction with our
 static files


 ***********************⭐M2⭐****************************
>>app.use('/assets', express.static('assets'))
//the first use() parameter is the matching route and the second is the matching folder
**********************************************************

Now whenever we make a request to the assets folder, it's gonna connect it to 
our assets folder, and it's gonna map in this folder and serve whatever what we request

//Now we can deal with our css static files that's in the assets folder normally
//we wont need to use the next() method anymore since the in-built express method take cares 
of all of this
