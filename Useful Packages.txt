✅Nodemon package✅ :
> while we are coding, it monitors our application files 
so when it's running on the browser while listening to a server,
it detects automatically the changes and renders them in the browser 
so we wont have to restart the server to see the modifications manually with
a simple refresh. so it simply just restarting the server for us each time 
we make a change and we can install it using this cmd : 

>> npm install -g nodemon

-g : means the installation will be globally, that means it won't install in our 
node_modules folder just on that application, it will be installed locally
so when we gonna need it on the future on another application, we wont have 
to install it again since it's already installed in my computer


⭐the last thing is to run our application we wont use "node app"
to run our app, we will use "nodemon app" instead
